# 3. How Agents Work Together
# - AgentController coordinates tasks by calling specialized agents.
# - Workflows can be triggered via CLI or programmatically.

# 4. Typical Workflows
# Component Generation:
#   figma -> Vue component -> Tests -> QA (visual, performance, accessibility)
# CI/CD Pipeline:
#   install -> test -> build -> deploy (with agent-driven automation)
# Full QA:
#   visual -> performance -> accessibility checks

# 5. Usage Examples

# CLI:
# python src/agents/agent_controller.py generate_component ProductCard "['product', 'onAddToCart']"
# python src/agents/accessibility_agent.py audit UserCard
# python src/agents/performance_agent.py benchmark UserCard

# Python:
# from agent_system import AgentController
# agent = AgentController()
# report = await agent.full_component_qa("UserProfile")

# 6. Extending the System
# - Add new agents in src/agents/ and register them in AgentController.
# - Each agent focuses on a single responsibility with async methods.
# - Use Continue API for LLM-powered code editing, analysis, suggestions.
#

# - src/agents/agent_controller.py for orchestration logic.
# - Individual agent files in src/agents/ for implementation details.
# - README.md for setup and additional usage.
