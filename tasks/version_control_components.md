# Task: Version Control for Components

## Objective
Implement a robust version control system for Vue components to ensure efficient tracking, management, and rollback of changes. This system will integrate seamlessly with the existing project infrastructure and provide both backend and frontend support for version management.

## Steps

### Backend Implementation
1. **Git Integration**:
   - Use Git to track changes in the `src/components` directory.
   - Ensure that all component files are properly staged and committed during development.
   - Implement hooks or scripts to enforce commit message standards for component changes.

2. **Version Tagging**:
   - Create a script to automate the process of tagging specific versions of components.
   - Use semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`) to maintain clarity.
   - Store metadata about each version, such as the author, timestamp, and commit message.

3. **Rollback Mechanism**:
   - Develop a script to facilitate rolling back to a specific version of a component.
   - Ensure that dependencies and related files are also reverted to maintain consistency.

### Frontend Implementation
4. **Dashboard UI**:
   - Design and implement a user-friendly interface in the dashboard for version management.
   - Features should include:
     - Viewing the history of changes for each component.
     - Comparing different versions of a component.
     - Reverting to a previous version with a single click.
   - Use visual indicators (e.g., color codes, icons) to highlight the status of components (e.g., modified, stable, deprecated).

5. **Notifications and Logs**:
   - Add notifications to inform users about successful version changes or rollbacks.
   - Maintain a detailed log of all version control activities for auditing purposes.

## Deliverables
- **Git-based Version Control**:
  - A fully functional Git integration for tracking and managing changes in the `src/components` directory.
- **Dashboard UI**:
  - A comprehensive interface for viewing, comparing, and reverting component versions.
- **Automation Scripts**:
  - Scripts for version tagging and rollback, ensuring smooth and error-free operations.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the version control system is extensible to accommodate future enhancements, such as integration with CI/CD pipelines or external version control tools.
- Conduct thorough testing to validate the functionality and reliability of the system before deployment.
