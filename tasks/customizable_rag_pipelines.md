# Task: Customizable RAG Pipelines

## Objective
Enhance the project by designing a robust and flexible configuration system that allows users to define and manage custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. This system should cater to diverse use cases by enabling dynamic pipeline customization and execution.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Schema Design for Pipeline Definitions
- Develop a comprehensive JSON/YAML schema to define RAG pipelines.
- Include support for specifying:
  - Data sources (e.g., databases, APIs, file systems).
  - Preprocessing steps (e.g., tokenization, filtering).
  - Retrieval mechanisms (e.g., vector search, keyword search).
  - Generation models and parameters (e.g., GPT variants, temperature settings).
  - Post-processing steps (e.g., formatting, validation).
- Ensure the schema is extensible to accommodate future enhancements.

### 2. Configuration Parser
- Implement a parser to load and validate pipeline configurations against the schema.
- Provide detailed error messages for invalid configurations.
- Support environment-specific overrides and dynamic parameterization.

### 3. Dynamic Pipeline Execution
- Modify `rag_server.py` to:
  - Dynamically construct and execute pipelines based on the loaded configuration.
  - Integrate logging and monitoring for pipeline execution.
  - Handle errors gracefully and provide actionable feedback.

### 4. Testing and Validation
- Develop unit tests for the schema and parser to ensure correctness and reliability.
- Create integration tests to validate end-to-end pipeline execution.
- Include performance benchmarks to assess the impact of dynamic execution.

### 5. Documentation and Examples
- Provide detailed documentation on:
  - Defining pipeline configurations using the schema.
  - Using the parser and troubleshooting common issues.
  - Examples of custom pipelines for different use cases.

## Deliverables
- **Pipeline Schema**: A well-documented JSON/YAML schema for defining RAG pipelines.
- **Configuration Parser**: A robust parser for loading and validating pipeline configurations.
- **Dynamic Execution Support**: Enhanced `rag_server.py` with dynamic pipeline execution capabilities.
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests for the schema, parser, and execution logic.
- **Documentation**: User-friendly guides and examples for defining and using custom pipelines.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure the system is scalable and can handle complex pipelines with minimal performance overhead.
- Follow best practices for security and data privacy when handling sensitive information in pipelines.
- Design the system to be user-friendly, with clear error messages and actionable feedback.
