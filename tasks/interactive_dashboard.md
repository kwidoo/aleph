# Task: Interactive Dashboard

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive, web-based interactive dashboard to monitor and manage AI agent tasks, performance metrics, and system logs. The dashboard should provide real-time insights and facilitate efficient decision-making for users.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Dashboard Interface Design
- Utilize Vue3 to design a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
- Ensure the design aligns with the project's existing UI/UX standards.
- Include customizable widgets for displaying various data points.

### 2. Real-Time Updates
- Implement real-time updates using WebSockets for seamless data synchronization.
- Alternatively, use a polling mechanism with optimized intervals to minimize server load.
- Ensure updates are efficient and do not degrade the dashboard's performance.

### 3. Data Integration
- Integrate task logs, performance metrics, and audit results into the dashboard.
- Provide filtering and sorting options for better data analysis.
- Ensure data is presented in a visually appealing and easily digestible format, such as charts, graphs, and tables.

### 4. User Management and Access Control
- Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
- Ensure sensitive data is accessible only to authorized users.

### 5. Localization Support
- Integrate localization features to support multiple languages.
- Ensure the dashboard is adaptable for a global audience.

### 6. Testing and Optimization
- Conduct unit and integration tests to ensure the dashboard's reliability.
- Optimize the dashboard for performance, ensuring quick load times and smooth interactions.
