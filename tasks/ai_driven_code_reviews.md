# Task: AI-Driven Code Reviews

## Objective
Implement an AI agent for automated code reviews to improve code quality and review efficiency.

## Background
Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality, ensuring adherence to coding standards, and facilitating knowledge transfer among team members. However, manual code reviews can be time-consuming and may not always catch subtle issues. An AI-driven code review system can automate parts of this process, providing consistent and objective feedback on code changes.

## Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse dataset of code samples and corresponding review comments. This dataset will be used to train the AI model.
2. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate machine learning model architecture for the code review task. Consider models that have shown success in natural language processing and code understanding.
3. **Training/Fine-tuning**: Train the model on the collected dataset. If a pre-trained model is used, fine-tune it on the code review dataset to adapt it to the specific requirements of the task.
4. **Agent Script Development**: Create a new agent script (e.g., `code_review_agent.py`) that utilizes the trained model to perform code reviews. The script should be able to analyze code changes and generate review comments.
5. **Integration**: Integrate the agent into the existing workflow for reviewing pull requests (PRs) or commits. Ensure that the agent can access the code changes and submit its review comments in the appropriate format.
6. **Testing and Validation**: Rigorously test the AI agent to ensure its reviews are accurate, helpful, and aligned with the team's coding standards. Validate the agent's performance on a separate test set of code samples.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the AI agent in the production environment, making it available for use in the code review process.

## Deliverables
- A trained or fine-tuned model for code reviews, capable of understanding code changes and generating relevant feedback.
- A `code_review_agent.py` script that implements the AI agent for code reviews.
- Documentation on how to use and integrate the AI agent into the existing code review workflow.
- Evidence of testing and validation, including metrics on the model's performance and examples of its reviews.
