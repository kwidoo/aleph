Here's a reviewed and expanded version of your task based on the original `documentation_generator.md` file. Iâ€™ve added necessary clarifications and broken down the requirements further to ensure completeness and make it easier for developers or AI agents to implement:

# ðŸ“„ Task: Documentation Generator

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Automate the generation of up-to-date, structured documentation for both **Vue components** and **AI agents**, using open-source tools and internal scripts.

## ðŸ§© Scope

1. **Vue 3 Components** â€” auto-generate documentation using source code comments (e.g., props, emits, slots).
2. **Agents (AI, Services, or CLI-based)** â€” document their behavior, configuration, endpoints, and usage patterns by extending existing Python scripts.

## ðŸªœ Steps

### 1. Vue Component Documentation

* Use **JSDoc**, **Vuese**, or similar tools compatible with Vue 3 + Composition API.
* Extract information from:

  * Props (types, defaults, validation)
  * Emits (events emitted by the component)
  * Slots (default or named)
  * Exposed methods (if any)
* Define where output files should be saved (e.g., `docs/components/`).
* Optional: Add examples or previews (e.g., using Storybook or MDX snippets).

### 2. Agent Documentation via `docs_indexer.py`

* Extend `docs_indexer.py` to support:

  * Parsing AI agent metadata (from YAML, Python decorators, or config files)
  * Capturing inputs, outputs, capabilities, usage examples
  * Linking agents to corresponding services/components
* Normalize output into markdown or JSON format.
* Place in `docs/agents/` directory.

### 3. Output Format

* **Option A**: Generate a Markdown-based documentation site using tools like Docusaurus, VuePress, or mkdocs.
* **Option B**: Generate standalone `.md` files grouped by folder and type (e.g., `/docs/components/*.md`, `/docs/agents/*.md`).

### 4. Consistency Rules

* Ensure naming conventions and structure align with other internal documentation (e.g., README or API specs).
* Auto-link related files (e.g., agent â†” handler â†” endpoint).

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables

* âœ… JSDoc (or equivalent) config and usage for Vue 3 components.
* âœ… Updated `docs_indexer.py` supporting agents.
* âœ… Final output in Markdown (optionally also static site).
* âœ… Optional: Documentation index or table of contents.

## ðŸ§  Additional Suggestions

* Add a `generate-docs.sh` CLI command to simplify local generation.
* Integrate into CI/CD pipeline (e.g., run on every commit to `main`).
* Include schema for agent metadata to ensure validation.
