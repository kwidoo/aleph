# Task: Accessibility Enhancements

## Objective
Enhance the project with advanced accessibility features to ensure inclusivity and compliance with global accessibility standards. This includes automating ARIA attribute generation, validating WCAG compliance, and providing actionable insights for improvement.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. ARIA Attribute Suggestions
- Extend the `accessibility_agent.py` to analyze components and suggest appropriate ARIA attributes.
- Ensure the suggestions are context-aware and align with the component's functionality.
- Provide detailed documentation for developers to understand and implement the suggestions.

### 2. WCAG Compliance Validation
- Integrate a validation mechanism within `accessibility_agent.py` to check components against WCAG 2.1 standards.
- Highlight areas of non-compliance and provide recommendations for fixes.
- Include support for different levels of compliance (A, AA, AAA).

### 3. Accessibility Reporting
- Develop a comprehensive reporting system to summarize accessibility issues and improvements.
- Include metrics such as the number of compliant components, unresolved issues, and overall accessibility score.
- Ensure the report is exportable in multiple formats (e.g., PDF, JSON).

### 4. Interactive Dashboard Integration
- Add a dedicated section in the projectâ€™s interactive dashboard for accessibility insights.
- Features to include:
  - Real-time validation of components.
  - Visualization of accessibility metrics.
  - Suggestions and fixes for identified issues.
- Ensure the UI is intuitive and aligns with the existing dashboard design.

## Deliverables
- **Enhanced `accessibility_agent.py`**: Extended functionality for ARIA attribute suggestions and WCAG compliance validation.
- **Accessibility Reports**: Detailed and exportable reports summarizing accessibility insights.
- **Dashboard Integration**: A user-friendly interface in the dashboard for managing and visualizing accessibility improvements.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure the accessibility system is scalable and adaptable to future updates in accessibility standards.
- Follow best practices for performance optimization to minimize the impact on application load times.
- Include unit tests for the agent and integration tests for the dashboard components.
