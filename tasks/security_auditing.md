# Task: Security Auditing

## Objective
Introduce a security agent for vulnerability scanning to proactively identify and mitigate security risks in the codebase.

## Background
Security vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and loss of reputation. Regular security auditing helps in early detection and remediation of such vulnerabilities.

## Tools
- **Bandit**: A tool designed to find common security issues in Python code.
- **Other Static Analysis Tools**: Consider integrating additional tools for comprehensive coverage.

## Steps
1. **Research and Select Tools**: Evaluate and choose appropriate tools for security scanning.
2. **Create Security Agent Script**: Develop a script (e.g., `security_agent.py`) to automate the scanning process.
3. **Integrate with CI/CD Pipeline**: Ensure the security agent runs at every stage of the development lifecycle.
4. **Schedule Periodic Scans**: Configure the agent to perform regular scans and generate detailed reports.
5. **Review and Remediate**: Establish a process for reviewing scan reports and addressing identified vulnerabilities.

## Deliverables
- Security agent script (`security_agent.py`).
- Documentation for integrating with Bandit or similar tools.
- Setup instructions for periodic scan scheduling and reporting.
- A report template for presenting scan results and remediation actions.
