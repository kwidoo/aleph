# Task: Advanced Testing Features

## Objective
Enhance the project with advanced testing capabilities, including mutation testing and visual regression testing, to ensure robust and reliable code quality.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Mutation Testing Integration
- Integrate a mutation testing library, such as `MutPy`, to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing test suite.
- Configure the library to work seamlessly with the current Python testing framework.
- Generate detailed reports highlighting areas of the codebase that require improved test coverage.

### 2. Visual Regression Testing for Vue Components
- Use a visual regression testing tool, such as `Percy`, to capture and compare visual snapshots of Vue components.
- Set up automated workflows to detect unintended UI changes during development.
- Ensure compatibility with the existing Vue3/TypeScript setup.

### 3. Update `test_agent.py`
- Extend the functionality of `test_agent.py` to include options for running mutation tests and visual regression tests.
- Add command-line arguments or configuration options to enable/disable these testing features.
- Ensure the script provides clear and actionable feedback for developers.

## Deliverables
- **Mutation Testing Integration**: A fully configured mutation testing setup with detailed reporting.
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Automated workflows for detecting UI regressions in Vue components.
- **Enhanced `test_agent.py`**: Updated script with support for advanced testing features.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure the testing tools are scalable and can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
- Follow best practices for performance optimization to minimize the impact of testing on development workflows.
- Include comprehensive documentation and unit tests for the new testing features.
