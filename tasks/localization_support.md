# Task: Localization Support

## Objective
Enhance the project with robust localization support to cater to a global audience. This includes integrating a translation management system, automating the extraction of translation keys, and providing a user-friendly interface for managing translations.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Integration with i18n for Vue3
- Use the `vue-i18n` library to enable internationalization in the Vue3 components.
- Configure the library to support multiple languages, including fallback options for untranslated keys.
- Ensure compatibility with the existing Vue3/TypeScript setup.

### 2. Script for Translation Key Management
- Develop a script to automate the extraction of translation keys from Vue3 components and TypeScript files.
- Store extracted keys in a structured format (e.g., JSON or YAML) for easy management.
- Include functionality to detect unused keys and highlight missing translations.

### 3. Translation Management UI
- Add a dedicated section in the projectâ€™s interactive dashboard for managing translations.
- Features to include:
  - Viewing and editing translation keys.
  - Importing and exporting translation files.
  - Real-time validation of translation completeness.
- Ensure the UI is intuitive and aligns with the existing dashboard design.

## Deliverables
- **i18n Integration**: Fully functional internationalization setup using `vue-i18n`.
- **Translation Key Management Script**: A script to extract, manage, and validate translation keys.
- **Translation Management UI**: A user-friendly interface in the dashboard for handling translations.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure the localization system is scalable to support additional languages in the future.
- Follow best practices for performance optimization to minimize the impact of localization on application load times.
- Include unit tests for the script and integration tests for the i18n setup and UI components.
