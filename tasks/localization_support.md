## Task: AI-Powered Localization Feature for Vue 3 Application with i18n Support

### Objective

Empower the AI assistant to generate, update, and maintain Vue 3 application code with full internationalization (i18n) capabilities, streamlining localization workflows and reducing manual effort.

### Scope

The AI assistant should be able to:

* Integrate and configure `vue-i18n` in a Vue 3 + TypeScript codebase.
* Automatically extract, manage, and validate translation keys.
* Suggest or apply translations when adding or updating UI text.
* Update a translation management interface within the application dashboard.

### Features & AI Assistant Responsibilities

#### 1. AI-Driven `vue-i18n` Integration

* **Code Generation**: Produce and insert the necessary setup for `vue-i18n` (plugin registration, locale files, fallback logic).
* **Configuration Updates**: Modify existing Vue 3 file structure and TypeScript types to support dynamic locale switching.

#### 2. Automated Translation Key Management

* **Extraction Script**: Generate a script that parses `.vue` and `.ts` files to extract translation keys into structured JSON/YAML.
* **Key Maintenance**: Detect unused or missing keys, flag discrepancies, and propose updates.
* **Locale File Updates**: Merge new keys into existing locale files without overwriting existing translations.

#### 3. Translation Suggestion & Completion

* **AI Suggestions**: Offer fallback translations or placeholders when new keys are introduced.
* **Validation**: Run checks for untranslated keys across supported locales and prompt for missing entries.

#### 4. Translation Management UI Integration

* **Dashboard Components**: Generate or update components within the application’s admin/dashboard to:

  * List and filter translation keys.
  * Edit translations in-line with real-time validation.
  * Import/export locale files in JSON/YAML.
* **UX Consistency**: Ensure generated UI matches existing design system and styling.

### Deliverables

1. **AI Assistant Code Modules**: Templates and helper functions for `vue-i18n` setup, key extraction, and validation.
2. **Extraction & Management Script**: CLI or Node-based script produced by the AI for translation key operations.
3. **Dashboard UI Components**: AI-generated Vue 3/TS components for translation management.
4. **Test Suites**:

   * Unit tests for extraction script and AI helper modules.
   * Integration tests verifying i18n setup and UI functionality.

### Additional Considerations

* **Scalability**: Support adding new languages without code changes.
* **Performance**: Lazy-load locale messages to minimize bundle size.
* **Extensibility**: Design AI prompts and templates so the assistant can adapt to project-specific naming conventions.
* **Documentation**: Auto-generate README updates or docs on how to use the AI-powered localization feature.
