# Task: Error Monitoring and Reporting

## Objective
Integrate comprehensive error monitoring and reporting tools, with a primary focus on Sentry, to enhance the application's reliability and maintainability.

## Background
Error monitoring and reporting are critical for identifying and diagnosing issues that occur in production. By integrating a tool like Sentry, we can gain real-time insights into errors, including detailed stack traces, affected users, and environment data. This information is vital for timely resolution and for improving the overall quality of the application.

## Steps
1. **Add Sentry SDK to the project.**
   - For Vue.js, use the `@sentry/vue` package.
   - For Python, use the `sentry-sdk` package.
2. **Configure error tracking.**
   - Initialize Sentry in the main entry file for both Vue and Python.
   - Ensure that errors from all components and scripts are captured.
3. **Set up environment variables.**
   - Configure DSN and other settings through environment variables to keep them secure.
4. **Create a dashboard section for error logs and analytics.**
   - Utilize Sentry's dashboard capabilities to monitor error trends and statistics.
   - Set up alerts for critical issues that need immediate attention.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Sentry SDK integration for both Vue and Python.
- [ ] Error tracking configured for all relevant parts of the application.
- [ ] A secure method for handling environment variables.
- [ ] A dashboard section set up in Sentry for monitoring error logs and analytics.
- [ ] Documentation on how to access and interpret the error reports and analytics.
