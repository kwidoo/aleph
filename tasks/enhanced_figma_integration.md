# Task: Enhanced Figma Integration

## Objective
Enhance the existing Figma integration to support bidirectional synchronization, enabling seamless updates between Figma and the application.

## Current Functionality
The `figma_integration.py` module currently provides the following features:
- Fetching Figma file structures and extracting component details.
- Converting Figma data into component specifications, including properties, styles, layout, and content.
- Mapping Figma styles to Tailwind CSS classes for streamlined frontend development.

## Planned Enhancements
1. **Bidirectional Sync**:
   - Extend the `FigmaParser` class to fetch updates from Figma in real-time.
   - Implement a mechanism to push changes made to Vue components back to Figma.

2. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Develop a system to handle simultaneous updates from both Figma and the application.
   - Provide clear notifications and options to resolve conflicts.

3. **Improved Component Mapping**:
   - Enhance the conversion logic to support more complex Figma designs.
   - Ensure compatibility with advanced Tailwind CSS features.

## Steps
1. Analyze the existing `FigmaParser` and `FigmaToVueAgent` classes to identify areas for extension.
2. Implement API endpoints for pushing updates to Figma.
3. Design a conflict resolution workflow and integrate it into the application.
4. Test the enhanced integration with various Figma files and Vue components.

## Deliverables
- Updated `figma_integration.py` with bidirectional sync capabilities.
- Mechanism for pushing changes to Figma.
- Conflict resolution implementation.
- Comprehensive documentation and test cases for the new features.
